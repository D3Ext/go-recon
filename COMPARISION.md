# Comparision

This file provides demo images about some of the ***go-recon*** tools to compare their performance with other well-known tools. Obviously, results may vary depending on the target, internet connection and a huge number of distinct factors. Moreover this doesn't mean that any tool is better than any other tool since go-recon can also be improved in a set of various aspects.

## Subdomain Enumeration

## HTTP Probing

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D3Ext/go-recon/main/static/comparision/httprobe.png">

Similar results, httpx is highly configurable

## Crawling

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D3Ext/go-recon/main/static/comparision/hakrawler.png">

In this case both tools are truly fast

## Urls Discovery

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D3Ext/go-recon/main/static/comparision/gauplus.png">

So, finally we see the three tools have similar results

## WAF Discovery

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D3Ext/go-recon/main/static/comparision/wafw00f.png">

Three tools detect the Cloudflare, anyways, Whatwaf is a little bit slower since it performs more exhaustive operations
